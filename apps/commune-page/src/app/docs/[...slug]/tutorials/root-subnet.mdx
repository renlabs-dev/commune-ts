## Root Subnet

The root subnet operates with **Root** consensus and is maintained by the protocol itself. Users cannot register this subnet.

The root subnet controls emission distribution across other protocol subnets. Instead of traditional miners, it uses subnets as miners. To become a validator on the root subnet, your stake must exceed that of the lowest-staked validator. The subnet has a 256-validator limit.

Root subnet consensus is determined by a weight-stake distribution through a sigmoid function, whose steepness is controlled by network parameters.
